# Global Development Indicators: SQL Case Study (2019–2021)

# Overview
This repository presents a comprehensive analysis of global development indicators using publicly available [datasets](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?dataStructure=Multiple%20tables&order=date_added%2Cdesc&page=2&pageSize=5) from the World Bank and UN Human Development Index (HDI) reports. The study focuses on identifying trends, disparities, and key development challenges across countries and regions between 2019 and 2021. Using SQL as the primary tool, the project answers a range of analytical questions related to economic growth, health outcomes, internet access, environmental sustainability, and composite development metrics.

The goal is to support evidence-based insights that can inform policy, development strategy, and future forecasting.

# Objectives
  Understand how GDP per capita varies by region and income group.

  Identify countries with the greatest improvements or declines in life expectancy, HDI, and GDP.

  Evaluate the relationship between energy use, internet access, and economic development.

  Quantify the effect of carbon emissions on life expectancy and sustainability.

  Create a custom Wellbeing Index combining education, life expectancy, and economic indicators.

  Detect countries that are consistently underperforming across both economic and human development metrics.

# Data Sources
  World Bank Open Data (country-level indicators across multiple years)
